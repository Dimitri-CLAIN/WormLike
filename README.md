## THE PROJECT
The goal of the project was to create an online game using [Unity Mirror](https://mirror-networking.com), an interface to program networking solutions on an Unity game.  
The project lasted 4 weeks, was supervised by [Alex Dana](https://github.com/MisterAlex95) Lead Web Developer at Ubisoft Paris and was done with a group of 4 people :  
- Pierre MARCURAT : Map, Sounds, Assets and Main Menu
- Dimitri CLAIN : Main Menu, Room Menu, Architecture
- Tim FERTIN : Gameplay

## THE GAME
We aimed to recreate our very own [Worms](https://store.steampowered.com/app/327030/Worms_WMD/) game with simplified options (no crafts, no different game modes, no sudden death or rising waters and so on...).  
We wanted to create a Room with a Lobby before the game that allows the clients to join the host to custom the game modes and settings (turn time, powers, health start amount...).  
We also wanted to adapt the [Marching Squares](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marching_squares) algorithm to allow the host to generate procedural maps that would fit the needs of our game but that was a bit too advanced...  

## CLONING, PLAYING AND WORKING ON OUR GAME
### Important information
To play our game, the host must enable port forwarding on 7777 on his/her router to allow clients from other networks to connect to his game instance. The game is still playable if he/she wants to play locally by creating multiple instances of the game.
### Working on the game
Feel free to check the code and message us if you have any questions or inquiries about what's going on, we'll do our best to help! :>
